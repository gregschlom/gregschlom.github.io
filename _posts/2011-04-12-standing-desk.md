Standing desks are ~~the latest trend~~ [all](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1835634) [the](http://thingsthatwelearn.com/#334875/Standing-Desk-Project) [rage](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2394868) in modern software development. All the cool guys are coding standing now.

Look:

A typical startup in Coalbrookdale, England, circa 1760. See any Aeron chairs? Nope. Standing desks? Check.

The thing is:

1. You’ll eventually get tired of standing, so you really need an *adjustable* standing desk.
2. Coworking spaces are also a must-have for any decent startup now, and few of them have standing desks. How do you get the benefits of both? 

In this guide, I’m going to teach you how to make your very own adjustable-height 360-degrees-pivotable standing desk, for free. And the best thing is: you won’t need a [pentalobular screwdriver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Pentalobe)!

Just follow this tutorial, lovingly illustrated with my best MS paint skills.

### Step 1. ###

Lower your chair to the minimum:

(If you don’t have an adjustable height office chair, you can stop here and get yourself a decent chair)

### Step 2. ###

Get your fat ass off your chair, put the chair on the desk, and your Mac Air Book Pro on the chair.

(Of course, if you have a [SPARC server](http://www.vibrant.com/images/products/sun_m9000.jpg), you have two problems now.)

### Step 3. ###

Adjust the height of the chair as needed, and enjoy your new standing desk.

**Pro tip:** you can even use the 360-degree z-axis pivot feature to show your work to your coworkers.

You think I’m kidding? I’m not kidding:
