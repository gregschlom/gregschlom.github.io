The fine folks from [Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com/) wrote in to let me know that the standing desk hack also works for people with a dual monitor set-up.

No, really. Check it out:

Of course you lose a little bit of screen real estate, since the two monitors are overlapping, but heck, it seems totally worth it. And at least now when he says he hasn’t seen your IM because Skype was in the background, he really means it.

(This mechanical retro IBM keyboard is totally awesome)

Thanks to Melissa, Skyler, and all the Grooveshark team. Keep up the good work. And careful not to drop any of those 20” monitors.
